Linear Regression on Actual vs Predicted Price of Car 
CarDekho.com is India's leading car search venture that helps users buy cars that are right for them. Its website and app carry rich automotive content such as expert reviews, detailed specs and prices, comparisons as well as videos and pictures of all car brands and models available in India. The company has tie-ups with many auto manufacturers, more than 4000 car dealers and numerous financial institutions to facilitate the purchase of vehicles.
CarDekho.com has launched many innovative features to ensure that users get an immersive experience of the car model before visiting a dealer showroom. These include a Feel The Car tool that gives 360-degree interior/exterior views with sounds of the car and explanations of features with videos; search and comparison by make, model, price, features; and live offers and promotions in all cities. The platform also has used car classifieds wherein users can upload their cars for sale, and find used cars for buying from individuals and used car dealers.
Besides the above consumer product features, CarDekho.com provides a rich array of tech-enabled tools to OE manufacturers and car dealers. These include apps for dealer sales executives to manage leads, cloud services for tracking sales performance, call tracker solution, digital marketing support, virtual online showroom and outsourced lead management operational process for taking consumers from enquiry to sale.
Our vision is to construct a complete ecosystem for consumers and car manufacturers, dealers and related businesses such that consumers have easy and complete access to not only buying and selling cars, but also manage their entire ownership experience, be it accessories, tyres, batteries, insurance or roadside assistance.
In this project, the dataset contains information about used cars listed on www.cardekho.com. This data can be used for a lot of purposes such as price prediction to exemplify the use of linear regression in Machine Learning.
The columns in the given dataset are as follows:
name
year
selling_price
km_driven
fuel
seller_type
transmission
Owner
Load up this dataset in the kernel and perform initial exploratory data analysis (EDA). You should also try creating new features based on the existing ones. The dependent variable is the selling_price.
Few things to keep in mind :
You should take care of categorical variables (variables which take discrete categories or classes) and do one-hot encoding to be able to pass them into the model.
Try to include as many plots and charts you can. This adds for a great visual interpretation of your tasks/activities.
Write detailed explanation of your approaches in the notebook and once you have some results, try to provide explanations for these observed results. Remember our objective is not only to build a machine learning model but to be able to explain why, what and how of the entire modeling process.
